# gnm Half-Day Course

Course materials for a half day introduction to generalized nonlinear models (GNMs) using the gnm R package, given as part of the [useR! 2019](http://www.user2019.fr/tutorials/) conference, July 9, 2019.

## Background Material

If you want to learn about/brush up on generalized linear models (GLMs) before working through this tutorial, you might want to look at my [Introduction to Generalized Linear Models](http://statmath.wu.ac.at/courses/heather_turner/) course. The landing page includes references to several books on GLMs/GLMs in R/related applications that the course was based on, which are recommended for further reading.

## Further Material on GNMs

For more on GNMs, you can refer to the following
 - [Full-day course on GNMs](https://github.com/hturner/gnm-day-course), including more on association modelling, including the use of the the **logmult** package, and examples of other multiplicative models (stereotype model, Rasch model, Lee-Carter model).
 - [gnm package vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gnm/vignettes/gnmOverview.pdf), including more detail on the functionality (controlling the fitting procedure, methods for the gnm model object, etc) and *more* examples (GAMMI model, biplot model, exponential decay model).
